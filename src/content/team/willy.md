## About

Howdy, I'm Will. I built this after seeing a Tweet from the legendary [Michael Cyger](https://x.com/MichaelCyger) and I thought it was a pretty good idea. 

**Fast, Simple, Easy, & Free.**

My goal with this side project is to build something people find useful. That's it.

There is no support email. 

Hit me up on X for improvements: [@helloIamWilly](https://x.com/helloIamWilly).

If you want something built, check out [StarterBuild](https://starterbuild.com).
