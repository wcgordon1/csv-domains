              If we got in touch with you about unauthorized charges and you
              think we have made a mistake, we will gladly look into this for
              you. We will have sent you a form that we need you to fill out in
              order for Spazio to revisit your account. Please fill out the
              verification form that was sent to you. Once you have completed
              the verification, we will revisit your account and follow up with
              you.

              Spazio is legally required to complete what is called a KYC (Know
              Your Customer) Survey for every user that signs up, which includes
              completing identity verification for the person who chooses to be
              the owner, administrator, and representative of a Spazio account.
              These requirements are intended to promote transparency and
              prevent individuals from using complex company structures to hide
              terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion, and other
              financial crimes. Usually, we are able to verify our users'
              identities automatically, but once in a while we are unable to and
              have to reach out for more information.

              Reserves are utilized to keep processing volume available within
              your Spazio account to fund refunds or chargebacks. There are
              several possible reasons a reserve may be placed at onboarding. It
              could be that your business operates in an industry or with a
              business model that potentially creates additional credit risk,
              even if you are not yet receiving chargebacks. Some businesses may
              also collect payment far in advance, creating additional risk.
              Most reserves are temporary, however, and we are happy to revisit
              if you provide additional information by replying to the
              notification email you received.

              We know how important it is to be able to accept transactions and
              payouts quickly in order for a business to continue running
              smoothly. Spazio is currently reviewing your submitted details so
              that we have a full understanding of your business. Unless we have

              and we will do our best to wrap our routine review up so you can
              get up and running.
